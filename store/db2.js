Until recently, net migration flow estimates produced every two years by the United Nations have served as the sole source of global migration flow data. More detailed measures, such as the immigration and emigration counts, or country-to-country bilateral flows are far better equipped to explain and predict global migration trends. Currently, only a minority of countries collect detailed flow data. In this study, these previous estimation methods are further devel- oped and applied to a much larger range of input data, allowing for a number of new insights from the resulting global bilateral flow estimates.",

The MGI looks at 15 countries—selected to provide a broad representation of levels of economic development, type of migration profile (including receiving and sending countries), and geographic scope—and uses 73 qualitative questions to measure performance across five domains identified as the building blocks of effective migration governance. These domains include: 1) institutional capacity, 2) migrant rights, 3) safe and orderly migration, 4) labour migration management, and 5) regional and international co-operation and other partnerships.",

This paper seeks to share those voices vis a vis the call for research concerning data, research and analysis concerning international migrants and displaced persons, and will consider the implications for scientific initiatives for migration research and analysis and for global policy and goals concerning migration and sustainable development.",

The results show that Google Trends can provide information that reflects the attractiveness of Switzerland for to immigrants from different countries and predict, to some extent, current and future (short- term) migration flows of adults arriving from Spain or Italy. However, the predictions appear not to be satisfactory for other flows (from France and Germany). Additional studies based on alternative approaches are needed to validate or overturn our study results.",
